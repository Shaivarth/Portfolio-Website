    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
I'm Sarthak Mishra, a passionate cybersecurity student with a strong focus on ethical hacking, penetration testing, and exploit development. I'm currently pursuing my B.Tech at VIT Bhopal University, where I actively explore tools like Kali Linux, Metasploit, Burp Suite, and more.

<br><br>My learning path includes mastering Python and Linux fundamentals, working toward certifications like CEH and OSCP, and practicing hands-on cybersecurity through platforms like TryHackMe. I'm also building a strong portfolio and aiming for global remote cybersecurity opportunities.

<br><br>Dedicated to continuous learning, I believe in progressing steadily every day—whether it’s writing scripts, analyzing vulnerabilities, or diving into low-level programming like Assembly. My ultimate goal is to become a skilled penetration tester and security researcher capable of solving real-world security challenges.
