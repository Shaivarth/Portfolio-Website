        <h2><code>ISC2 Candidate</code></h2>
        <p>
I’m officially recognized as an ISC2 Candidate, a designation for individuals actively pursuing a cybersecurity career and working toward globally respected certifications like CC (Certified in Cybersecurity). As a Candidate, I’ve agreed to the ISC2 Code of Ethics and gained access to their exclusive learning platform and professional community.
<br><br>
I have completed all the required lessons and learning modules related to the CC exam, covering key domains such as security principles, network security, access controls, risk management, and incident response. With the training and knowledge now in place, I’m fully prepared and only need to schedule and appear for the certification exam.        </p>

        <h2>EC-Council : <code>Raspberry Pi 4 Model B: Multi-OS Setup including Raspbian and Ubuntu</code></h2>
        <p>
I successfully completed the "Raspberry Pi 4 Model B: Multi-OS Setup" certification by EC-Council, which focused on setting up and configuring multiple operating systems — including Raspbian and Ubuntu — on the Raspberry Pi 4 platform.
<br><br>
This certification strengthened my practical understanding of Linux-based systems, ARM architecture, and multi-boot configurations. It also enhanced my ability to perform OS-level customizations, manage system resources, and use the Raspberry Pi as a lightweight yet powerful cybersecurity lab environment.
<br><br>
The skills gained through this certification have been instrumental in my ongoing ethical hacking and pentesting practice, especially when working with embedded systems and IoT security.</p>
